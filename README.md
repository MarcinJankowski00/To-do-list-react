## Description

A website where you can create a to-do list. You can add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. Additionally, you can mark all tasks as completed with one button. You can hide completed tasks. You can download sample tasks. The website also has a subpage with information about the author. The website includes a search feature that filters all tasks and displays the searched tasks. The site is in Polish.

## Instruction

To add a task, enter the content in the empty field, and then press the blue button on which it says "Dodaj zadanie".

To mark a completed task, press the green square button to the left of the task.

To remove a task from the list, press the red square button to the right of the task.

To mark all completed tasks, press "Ukończ wszystkie".

To hide all marked tasks, press "Ukryj ukończone".

To show all hidden tasks, press "Pokaż ukończone".

To download sample tasks, click the "Pobierz przykładowe zadania" button.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
